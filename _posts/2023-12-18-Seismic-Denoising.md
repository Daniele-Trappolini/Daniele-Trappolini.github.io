title: "Seismic Denoising meets Generative Image Models"
---

Exciting news! Our seismic denoising work has been featured in an insightful article, thanks to Alex Saoulis from UCL for the fantastic write-up. This article explores the innovative use of generative models in seismic data analysis, highlighting the significant impact on our understanding of Earth's movements. It's a testament to the groundbreaking research and hard work of our team.

For an in-depth look at this pioneering approach, I encourage you to read the article. It's a great example of how technology is advancing our field.
