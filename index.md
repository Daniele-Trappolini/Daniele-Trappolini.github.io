I am currently a Ph.D student at Sapienza University of Rome, and my scholarship is co-funded by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), with whom I maintain close collaboration. My collaboration with the institute is based on the fact that my Ph.D. research focuses on the application of machine learning in the field of geoscience, specifically in the mitigation of natural disasters. 

So far, the projects I have worked on in this area include Extreme Weather Nowcasting, Ground Motion Prediction, and Seismic Waveform Denoising. My fields of expertise include deep learning modeling and data analysis in particular those produced by earth observation, data visualization, and statistical modelling.
