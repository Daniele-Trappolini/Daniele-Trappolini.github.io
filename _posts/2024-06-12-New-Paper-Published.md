Great news everyone! The preprint of my latest paper, titled "Cold Diffusion Model for Seismic Denoising," has just been published on the JGR Machine Learning and Computation. This paper presents a novel approach to seismic denoising using a Cold Diffusion Model.

You can access the paper using the following link: [Cold Diffusion Model for Seismic Denoising - JGR Machine Learning and Computation](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JH000179).

I'm excited to share this work with the research community and would appreciate any feedback or comments you may have. Stay tuned for further updates!
