Great news everyone! The preprint of my latest paper, titled "Cold Diffusion Model for Seismic Denoising," has just been released on the ESS Open Archive. This paper presents a novel approach to seismic denoising using a Cold Diffusion Model.

You can access the preprint using the following link: [Cold Diffusion Model for Seismic Denoising - ESS Open Archive](https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.170964927.71674979/v1).

I'm excited to share this work with the research community and would appreciate any feedback or comments you may have. Stay tuned for further updates!
